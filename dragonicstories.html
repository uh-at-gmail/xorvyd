            <p>Date: xx/xx/xxxx New Hobby is getting Dangerous...?</p>
            <p>This new hobby that has been happening at the same time im reading three body problem e-stone ink on my stone tablet 2.0, its a tcg called yugioh. Ive been curious about the game since forever but never tried it out until now. Good thing it happened last year cause who knows if i would go broke before reaching this last year, im talking about the physical card collecting and the hellscape in tcg card value. All you need is a push to play the game and that is it. My exposure was with classmates and the anime, never knew theres console games of it but those were during the early days popularity and i was a dumb baby dragon with no conscious.</p>
            <p>I am not doing anything crazy with my deck since my deck building is yet to be decent, but because of the value of yugioh cards being all over the place, should i be happy that majority of the cards are cheap down to the cents? its a breeding ground for dropping money on cards and saying that <i>'it wont hurt much'</i> but the total says otherwise aka gambling.</p>
        <p>Date: xx/xx/xxxx Reading Progress~</p>
        <p>I managed to reach the 50% point in the stone tablet collection: three body problem, yahooooooooo (I have to let you know that i had to renew the loan because it is taking me a while to get through because of school). There were some scenes where I kinda zoned out because stuff happened and the story is taking a little detour before the meat of the story comes back at end of chapters. That's normal in every story I read if I like the contents, i'll say it's been keeping my interest to keep reading even though it may depends on my mood when i boot up my stone tablet 2.0.</p>
        <p>I forgot to talk about Detention the last time I updated, it's been a week or two or more. Anyways, Detention is a horror side scrolling point and click that centers around twoish protagonists, you follow the life of a highschool student and how the events unfold and the external factors affects her life. <small>It also kickstarted my interest in chinese language and culture even though its a taiwanese game</small> Nonetheless, I recommend if you like horror, you may end up learning a bit of taiwanese culture.</p>
        <p>Speaking of taiwanese entertainment, i cried at this taiwanese romantic comedy called 'Our Times'.</p>
        <p>Also where is the book i requested from the library? why are you still in transit, its been 4 days please help me o-o</p>
            <div>
            <p>Date: xx/xx/xxxx I am surprised</p>
            <p>So there is this TouYuber who I get shorts from and when I decided to take a look at their channel, one of their videos made me shook from the coincidence because I just so happen to be reading this book: The Three Body, take a look at the pictogram, it is the first scene.</p>
            <a href="url">https://youtu.be/_P2fXdg88zw?si=WMuCN2mvMF0Zg8up</a>
            <p>This character Kenan plays should be a spoiler for me since I haven't met this character from where I am at.</p>
            <p>From what I can tell you without spoiling, I am going to make a hazardous guess that this woman in the scene is Ye Wenjie, she had interacted with another western man in an earlier scene and knows English.</p>
            <p>The early chapters established that no one should be radicalized by western ideas, it goes against the ideas put down by Chairman Mao and you can't even credit notable western men that made theories on topics, in this case science and physics.</p>
            <p>It is based on real events on Chinese history in the 1960s with splash of sci fi elements for a plot point, guess what other media i know of that has a similar struggle in the 1960: Detention.</p>

            <p>Date: xx/xx/xxxx Reading on Stone Tablet Pt. 3</p>
            <p>The stone tablet I scavenged in the WestField Topanga Plains feels fragile, I hope it does-- oh I can't read Spanish. Uhh all I can read is Tu Madre.</p>

            <p>Date: xx/xx/xxxx Found a Stone Tablet</p>
            <p>I found a Stone Tablet stuck somewhere deep in my cave, I wonder if I can read them. I will have to raid some poor bloke's house in order to decipher. Hm? How I know English? What's <i>English</i>?</p>
