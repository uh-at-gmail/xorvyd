        <h3>Wait why are there movies? I thought this a game series?</h3>
        <img src="sora excuse me.gif">
        <p>Games that were released on older handheld with the exception of Birth By Sleep and Dream Drop were
            rereleased in
            condensed movies as a part of the HD port collections.</p>
        <h3>Can I skip games I don't find interesting and go straight to the next installments? (eg. only play numbered
            titles and skipping "side games")</h3>
        <p>I strongly do not recommend that, I've seen on accounts of people saying they only played Kingdom Hearts I,
            II
            and III and complained about the story. I do not know if they are trolling or genuinely set themselves up,
            it is
            tempting to think that they are standalone, but they are not. You will be missing out in dialogue details,
            contexts requiring previous knowledge and lose the impact that carries over, this game wants you to engage
            with
            the stories. </p>

        <h4 id="jumpkh">Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</h4>
        <p>Recommended to start here, the age of this game translate over to modern consoles. This is the most clunkiest
            gameplay you‚Äôll ever deal with for this series, but fortunately you can get used to it. </p>
        <img src="sora wave.gif">
        <p> The entry of the series, follow a young 14 year old boy named Sora, who he and his friends Riku and Kairi
            build
            a raft together to leave their island. After tragedy strikes, Sora was left to fend for himself while
            darkness
            takes over his home. Meanwhile in another world, Donald and Goofy are tasked by their King to ‚Äúfind the
            key‚Äù,
            which leads them to a refugee world called Traverse Town. Sora also ends up at Traverse Town, and finds out

        <p>The second game of the series was originally on Gameboy Advance, later ported to the Playstation 2 with voice

            each

        <h4 id="jumpkh2">Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</h4>
        <img src="kingdom hearts 2.gif">
        <p>Welcome to Kingdom Hearts <img width="150" height="150" src="two.gif"> (two).</p>
        <p>Regarded as the best sequel game of the whole series by the fandom, the gameplay is a step up compared to the
            simple hack n slash from the first being the most fluid, fast and flashy that makes you question that it
            came
            from a Playstation 2 game. With a new gameplay mechanic that is the first and last time you ever see:
            reaction
            commands. The reaction commands gives either a new way to defeat the heartless and the mysterious new
            enemies a
            run for their money or gives a mini cinematic of Sora who self-improve fights after sleeping in cold storage
            for
            a year. Ok Sora we see you, interestingly if you look for forums of people‚Äôs rating back in the day, no one
            liked the reaction commands compared to someone‚Äôs review in recent times. Because of this, the director
            never
            made the return for reaction commands, but people have been wishing for it to come back after Kingdom Hearts
            III, so it will in future titles.</p>
        <p>Lastly there is another gameplay mechanic that is exclusive to Kingdom Hearts 2 called Drive Form. The
            tutorial
            will mention it but what it doesn‚Äôt tell you is how each drive form controls a specific movement which by,
            leveling up, will eventually grant you that movement permanently. Originally there was not much use outside
            of
            battle and quality of life, but now in the Final Mix version, it became necessary to progress the optional
            post-game area Cavern of Remembrance and/or make the other optional battles easier. Here is a guide that
            will
            tell you the best farming area to level up these drive forms, while it is not required for the story, you
            can
            get away with just bashing around with the keyblade.</p>

        <p>This game was the first game I started with, I‚Äôm the only idiot in the family who has this unhealthy
            attachment
            to the series. It was probably factored in the fact that I liked the Disney movies growing up so combine it
            with
            ‚Äòoh there‚Äôs Disney characters on the cover‚Äô. I literally do not know who I‚Äôll be if my parents didn‚Äôt get
            this
            game from Walmart‚Ä¶</p>

        <h4 id="jumpkhdays">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</h4>
        <img src="roxas hit.gif">
        <p>The first of the Kingdom Hearts collection to get a movie instead of a port rip, this features a 3-hour long
            cutscenes recapping the DS game with mostly voiced cutscenes and some text to read for some missions. While
            this
            gets the job done, the premise is the most heart wrenching story that follows a newly recruited fellow named
            Roxas who later learns the true purpose of his recruitment. There are some scenes that are more impactful in
            the
            original game, which is unfortunate, but fortunately you can find online of the DS port on an emulator. I am
            not
            linking it for obvious reasons but it should be searchable. When I played this game on the DS, I never
            finished
            it for the longest time as a kid because one, I was stuck on a boss fight mission and two, I was level one
            and
            didn't know you had to manually update your level. But once I passed the hurdle, I cried at the end of the
            game.

        <h4 id="jumpkhbbs">Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep Final Mix</h4>
        <img src="kh bbs.gif">
        <p>A prequel that released on the PSP that follows a trio who are keyblade warriors preparing to take a mark of
            mastery exam, which is their life‚Äôs goals. What‚Äôs unique to this story is that you follow three separate
            characters and follow their POV of the events. This sounds tedious but playing through the game without
            worrying
            about 100% completion should not take as long. In concern to which character order you should play, the
            character order I typically play are Terra > Ventus > Aqua which is the default during selection.
            Technically
            you can start with either Ventus or Terra, but you definitely need to play Aqua last due to end game story
            relevance. Each characters will obtain various keyblades (minus the keyblades earned in Disney worlds) that
            put
            emphasis into the archtype of each character stats strength. Starting with Terra while his personal stats
            are
            equal between strength and magic, his keyblades put more oomph to his strength. Next, Ventus‚Äôs personal
            stats
            are about equal in strength and defense, his keyblade may either put more to strength or be about the same
            in
            both strength and magic. And lastly Aqua‚Äôs personal stats starts with an obvious more stats with magic
            compared
            to the other stats, and her keyblades also put more oomph into magic while some will even it out with some
            strength. And she is your first female playable character, girl boss. What the hell am I pulling these info
            from? (source: <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/943347-kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep/faqs/60066">
                for
                general leveling stats</a> (do not read this whole guide obviously) and <a
                href="https://guiding-key.tumblr.com/khbbs-keyblades"> for all possible earned keyblades between all the
                characters</a>, spoilers to where you need to go to earn it.)</p>
        <p>Also if you decided to 100% complete this game or platinum trophy, I applaud to you because this game is
            infamous
            for simply the fact that any collecting, crafting or post-game enemies to defeat has to be done three times.

        <h4 id="jumpkhrecode">Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded</h4>
        <img src="kh recoded.gif">
        <p>Re:Coded was originally a mobile game that was released episodic in Japan that later became a DS game
            international. This game is infamous for not only the story, but by the fandom as the most skippable game,
            this
            with Re:COM for gameplay. While the collection made this as a movie, the story can be summarized as a
            strange
            message appears in Jiminy‚Äôs journal that was never there before and asked King Mickey for help. While they
            digitalize the journal, they happen to digitalize a data version of Sora and asked him to reenact to figure
            out
            where the strange message had come from. While data Sora chases a cloaked figure that appeared in the
            digital
            worlds, the castle in the real world was overrun by heartless and just in time, data Sora arrives. Confused,
            the
            cloaked figure turns out to be Riku, but a form of the Journal (how the hell did I not remember that I‚Äôm a
            fake
            fan). But data Sora and King Mickey can‚Äôt coexisting in the real world, right? Data Riku explains that they
            are
            now in the digital world called the Datascape. You got your typical antagonist which are the real-world
            Maleficent and Pete who have their own evil agenda that are up to no good, but instead of an elaborate plan,
            they are there take over the datascape, sounds like a clich√© plot for them. The wiki never mentions it, but
            how
            the real-world Pete and Maleficent got into the datascape is because Pete was going to confront King Mickey
            about his plan like an idiot poop face, but then a bright light engulfed somewhere in the datascape world,
            it
            was so bright that it also took some participants in the real world so that‚Äôs how Pete got in. He obviously
            called in Maleficent but if [this section that spoils a plot of the Disney Castle lore] likely has a [minor
            theorizing that relates to the Disney Castle lore]. After that first part is resolved and King Mickey is
            back
            into the real world, data Sora has one more thing left to do, to figure out the strange message and how it
            relates to him. Apparently, the DS of Re:Coded has the best gameplay combat compared to 358/2 days; I know
            my
            sister can attest to that. I hate that I had to refer to the wiki to remember this plot of a story.</p>

        <h4 id="jumpkhddd">Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD</h4>
        <img src="kh ddd.gif">
        <p>Dream drop, 3D, or DDD, this game continues after Kingdom Hearts 2 and the events of Re:coded where Sora and
            Riku
            are summoned by Master Yen Sid to prepare to take the mark of mastery in order to be able to face the
            formidable
            foe, Master Xehanort and rescue their lost allies. During the test they are to traverse through seven of the
            sleeping worlds to free it from its sleeping state and restore the worlds. During their journey, Sora and
            Riku
            are aided by these new creatures which they can command called Dream Eaters, the enemies you face in the
            sleeping worlds are called Nightmares. While the exam was supposed to be a simple test, it becomes apparent
            that
            a force of a particular group was interfering.</p>
        <p>This gameplay incorporate gameplay elements in BBS and is not the first time you play with Sora and Riku. A
            unique way they make you play between the two protagonist is the creation of a drop system which is a timer.
            This makes you unable to switch manually and must play within a certain amount of time between them except
            for
            scripted drops. But the only downside is that if you were in a middle of a boss fight and your drop timer
            ran
            out, you will have to restart that boss fight, first world problem. There is also a new movement called flow
            motion, this helps you explore new environment that is made to feel vast compared to the last entries. I
            personally did not know how to use it at first because I played Kingdom Hearts 3 before dream drop, oops?
        </p>
        <p>Lastly there is a story element that is subjective, it is used as a plot point for a reason why this
            character
            does the thing as a reason they do and not everyone liked it. And because of that, it became one of the many
            opinions to what people generally don‚Äôt like about this game. I personally did not finish this game because
            I
            got stuck on one of the late game boss fights and I didn‚Äôt reach to the scenario where that plot point
            happens
            to make my judgement on it.</p>
        <p>I decided to find a guide based on the Dream Eaters because your abilities are tied to the creatures, that
            means
            managing them instead of the typical way of leveling up and earning them.</p>

        <h4 id="jumpkhx">Kingdom Hearts X Back Cover</h4>
        <img src="kh back cover.gif">
        <p>Before we had our global mobile game called Union Cross released in 2015, there was a browser game called X
            [chi]
            that was released in Japan and never saw the light in the West. While although we did get Union Cross,
            apparently the story in X is not the same in Union Cross so I decided to only provide Union Cross Youtube
            video,
            warning do not watch in one sitting, its 11 hours long. I remember playing Union Cross on my phone back in
            High
            School, there was a lot of missions you had to go through (it was 700+ missions <img width="40" height="50"
                src="huh.gif">) and I only played up to 200 because I didn't have good stats as a free to play to push
            through, oh well.</p>

        <p>I am lumping Back Cover with Union Cross because the premises share the same characters and there is no way
            to
            play these games anymore (same for dark road recently). Since it's shutdown in 2021 (Union Cross), the only
            viable option is watching cutscenes on Youtube.</p>
        <iframe width="900" height="570" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UxHAz1mz3HA"

        <p>I hate to confess, I never quite finished Union Cross massive story other than too many missions for bits and
            pieces of the story, but now someone complied all of it in one go. So that means I have no excuse to skip
            the
            contents of Union Cross and for Dark Road which I also did not consume. To give where credit is
            due, people have praised this game and Dark Road for the best writing.</p>

        <h4 id="jumpkh02">Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep 0.2 A Fragmentary Passage</h4>
        <img src="kh 02.gif">
        <p>The promised Birth By Sleep volume 0.5 takes place after the events of Birth By Sleep where Master Aqua falls
            to
            the realm of darkness and stumbles upon Castle of Dreams. In the twisted reality where time flows
            differently,
            she also starts to hallucinate her friends and descend deep in her despair and darkness. This is a short
            game
            that fans dubbed as a tech demo since it is a precursor of what we expect in terms of models and gameplay
            wise
            before the release of Kingdom Hearts III. </p>
        <p>Also why did I buy the 2.8 collection separately when I should have bought the collection that has all of the
            HD
            in one package excluding KH 3 instead? That would‚Äôve satisfied my KH 2 craving to play on PS4 and I didn‚Äôt
            have
            to buy the 1.5 and 2.5 collection merge separate either !!!! dumb ass. Actually, I did buy the 1.5 and 2.5
            collection separate during the initial release on PS3, who am I to say. </p>

        <h4 id="jumpkh3">Kingdom Hearts III</h4>
        <img src="kh 3.gif">
        <p>Kingdom Hearts III takes place after Dream drop, all I will say is that Sora has a new task to keep up ever
            since
            his powers were stripped away. The gameplay is a culmination of all of the past game mechanic mashed into
            one in
            an updated look, there is a DLC that expands the base game story but also adds in additional content called
            Limit Cut. I saw an easy mistake to do when watching scenes in Re: Mind, it will recap certain base game
            scenes,
            but it will have new scenes that were not present in the base game. You should keep in mind before trying to
            skip cutscenes.</p>
        <p>Funny story how I got this game, my sister won a best buy gift card from those rigged arcade games and while
            I
            didn‚Äôt expect myself to play KH 3 on initial release year, with the gift card I decided to get it.</p>
        <p>Also not to be a downer but in the community, Kingdom Hearts III was the most anticipated and long waited
            numbered title that faced a lot of disappointment between fans. There are some valid reasons to why this
            happened, first because of the hype it is kind of inevitable to get loud disappointment among long time fans
            that waited years for this game to release. I too also waited years for this installment to release, it was
            yesterday that I was in middle school and the announcement trailer revealing the development was back in
            2013.
            Another reason is that for those long time fans and even casual had all of the time to sit on with the
            stories
            to make up a head cannon on what they think will happen at the end of KH 3. All I can really say is to not
            involve yourself in any online opinions of this game in both positive and negative, for some reason this
            game is
            a trigger to certain fans and they would fight on you that KH 2 is so much better than KH 3. I don‚Äôt know
            why
            they always compare it to KH 2 beside the fact that it is likely nostalgia and whichever they deemed better
            than
            the other. I pulled this observation out of twitter, but I am sure in other sites there are people that
            share
            the same sentiment, lastly I also noticed for new comer who didn‚Äôt had to wait between games loved this game
            so
            yeah. There is also discussion that people are going to shit on KH 4 whenever that releases lol. To be fair
            KH 2
            is my nostalgia game that I revisit more than the others, but I wouldn‚Äôt really put KH 3 burning on a stake
            just
            because I did not have strong feelings for it.</p>

        <h4 id="jumpkhmom">Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memories</h4>
        <img src="kh mom.gif">
        <p>Melody of Memories a rhythm game that recently released back in October 2020, I remember because I was a
            sophomore to junior and my classes was still on Zoom. I digress, this is the only spin off game that is
            never
            included in package and is always sold separately. If playing rhythm game is not your forte, you can just
            watch
            the cutscenes on Youtube. I will warn you that it is literally a recap from Kairi explaining the events all
            the
            way from the first game (minus UX (union cross)). You only receive new story elements that teases the next
            arc
            at the end of the game and in my opinion, she's really done dirty in this game.</p>
