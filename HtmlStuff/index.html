        <p>Welcome my dear travelers to my humble abode, I hope your stay in this abode is the most memorable~</p>
        <p>My name is Xorvyd, I also go by Xor for short. I am a red dragon that has been living in this cave ever since my kind disappeared....</p>
        <p>What you do here is none of my business, but feel free to explore sections of my cave. Please follow these links-- I mean some wooden signs I gracefully added, they are self explanatory and should lead you to where you desire~</p>
        <p><b>DO NOT TAKE ANY OF THE CONTENTS YOU SEE SERIOUSLY, ALL IS CREATED FOR FUN</b></p>
