   <h3>How to start this Series</h3>
   <img src="namine stairs.gif">
   <p>You search online under Reddit, blogs, forums, etc. but there are many conflicting ideas on where to start, don't worry! I got your back! Each entry to these games will have a link to respective sites to help guide for general walkthrough to gameplay grinds. Links to buy the game will be provided based on most accessible option if applicable.</p>
   <i>Recommended Order: Release Dates</i>
   <p>As a veteran player and fanatic for this series, I <em>strongly</em> urge you to play in release order. This will prevent you from spoiling any reveals that shows up later down the games. Release order is based on US, ignoring HD collection release package.</p>
   <p>All original game titles are titled to recent definitive versions.</p>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix </li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days Movie </li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded Movie</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep Final Mix</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts X Back Cover Movie</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth By Sleep Fragmentary Passage (Part of 2.8 Final Final Chapter Prologue)</li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts III </li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Dark Road </li>
    <li>Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory </li>

    <h3>Wait why are there movies? I thought this a game series?</h3>
    <img src="sora excuse me.gif">
    <p>Games that were released on older handheld with the exception of Birth By Sleep and Dream Drop were rereleased in condensed movies as a part of the HD port collections.</p>
    <h3>Can I skip games I don't find interesting and go straight to the next installments? (eg. only play numbered titles and skipping "side games")</h3>
    <p>I strongly do not recommend that, I've seen on accounts of people saying they only played Kingdom Hearts I, II and III and complained about the story. I do not know if they are trolling or genuinely set themselves up, it is tempting to think that they are standalone, but they are not. You will be missing out in dialogue details, contexts requiring previous knowledge and lose the impact that carries over, this game wants you to engage with the stories. </p>

   <h4>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</h4>
   <p>The entry to this series, recommended to start here. The age of this game translate over to modern consoles, this is the most clunkiest gameplay youâ€™ll ever deal with for this series, but fortunately you can get used to it. </p>

   <!-- <h4>Myths</h4>
   <p>I thought to let you know common internet myths about this game series that people outside looking in commonly say that isn't true.</p>
   <ul><i>Kingdom Hearts is a kids game.</i>
    <li>Disney is for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
   <ul><i>B-But DiSNEY </i>
    <li>They are secondary characters and worlds to the overarching plot, they are a part of it but if you are worried with how involved the disney story affects the Kingdom Hearts plot, don't worry I assure you the main center story will always be Kingdom Hearts, it is an adventure game.</li>
    </ul>
   <ul><i>Um, actually Kingdom Hearts is confusing.</i>
    <li>I'm tired of seeing this and is one of the infamous question or comment that generalises the series as a whole, remember you need to be invested in the story in order to keep up with the plot points. People tend to not read and miss out or forget to pay attention to certain scenes, this is why each installments always recap everytime there is new plot threads in each games. And just in, the director rewatches recaps videos on his own game, we literally cannot hold decades of story in one go without backtracking. And before you blame it on the guy, there's multiple writers so it is not just Nomura doing all of the writing.</li>
   </ul> -->

<h4>Extras:</h4>
   <p><i>Love the games but want more?</i> There are several options you can get your hands on:</p>
    <ul>Kingdom Hearts Manga
    <li>gives recaps of the story in games in funny lighthearted way. Rent them from the library if I were you, for better translation.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Kingdom Hearts Light Novel 
    <li>similar to manga but more closer to the games tones, establish points that never shown in games. While it can be considered non-canon especially for important characters thoughts and actions, Tetsuya Nomura is still credited in these light novels.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Kingdom Hearts Ultimania
    <li>If you rather not spend money for this book, one alternative would be KHInsider that holds all translated interviews post game developments. You may have seen this website for the collection of other video game music.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>The original Kingdom Hearts released games
    <li> You are more than <em>just a fan</em>, you are now a collector who thinks about this game series a lot.</li>
    </ul>
