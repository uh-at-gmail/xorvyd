        <h3 id="jumpGS">Getting Started</h3>
        <p>Before you get started on your reading journey, it is important to know where to start picking up books based
            on
            their genres. While I can’t list all, the self-explanatory names should give you an idea about the content
            of
            the books. Some books contain multiple genres and will appear in each label.</p>
        <p>One easy way to guess the type of genre you may like is by referencing based on your type of media you
            consume,
            it does not matter if its movies or video games, you can deduce based on themes. Or you can just grab a book
            because of the premise sounds interesting, the world is your oyster.</p>

        <h3 id="jumpP">Accessing Physical Books</h3>
        <p>Getting physical books are easy as grabbing it at grocery stores, but your mileage may vary in selections. In
            big
            retail stores you are guaranteed to have at least a shelf with multiple genres sorted, or you can go out of
            your
            way to visit dedicated bookstores or secondhand stores. And of course you can always grab them at your local
            public library.</p>
        <p>It is hard to tell how much bookstores have changed over the years ever since its popularity on social media,
            one
            thing I will always remember is visiting Barnes & Noble back in the day where the manga shelf was only one,
            if
            you check any this year, they likely have bigger dedicated section for manga and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_novel">light novels</a>. You will be paying full price at
            Barnes &
            Noble, if you rather save money, your best bet is to find them in any secondhand stores or buy them online.
            One
            site I recommend buying physical books is called <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/">ThriftBooks</a>, but
            be
            aware that depending on the popularity of the books, the retail value versus second hand may not be much
            different. Another site I’ve seen being recommended is called <a href="https://pangobooks.com/">Pango</a>,
            it is
            a secondhand site where you buy off readers looking to sell their books.</p>
        <p>I thought it would be important to share the different type of of book printing to help identify even though
            it
            is obvious to many.</p>
        <p>Before we discuss the simple guide of books you can find in the wild, I will note that I won’t deep dive and
            explain a lot of the nuances in printed books regardless of which it was published in. But there will be a
            brief
            mention of content in books, assuming it applies to either hardcover or softcover/paperback since I can’t
            definitively check for all types of books.</p>
        <h4>Hard Cover</h4>
        <p>Books that contain stiffer boards and a dust jacket, made to last longer than paperback for resistance to
            wear
            from repeated use. Also are made with higher quality materials and papers, tend to cost more. </p>
        <h4>Special Edition Hard Cover</h4>
        <p>Publishing company may print out limited edition books that are exclusive, usually contain alternative art
            cover
            on dust jacket, have simple decorative foil on the cover, and colored spray edges. For example, Barnes &
            Noble
            standard exclusive book usually contain bookmark or poster.</p>
        <h4>Subscription Box Service</h4>
        <p>Some of the most notable companies are Book of the Month, OwlCrate, FairyLoot, Illumicrate, etc. These tend
            to
            ship out books in hard cover and depending on the subscription service, they may tailor to have additional
            items
            or have exclusive book version with author note and signature. These types of books are high in collector
            value
            and tend to follow the book trend in whichever is popular now, but I find them only worth it if you liked
            the
            alternative art that is in collab with these companies and the book.</p>
        <h4>Paperback</h4>
        <p>Spray edges are not just for Hardcover, some paperbacks do have it and depending on the edition, it may have
            its
            own cover flaps mimicking dust jacket. But did you know that publisher may just release a common paperback
            but
            with spray edges? Spray edges just recently became something to drive up sales and for attractive looks.
            Anyways
            let’s see the difference in why some paperbacks are sized differently compared to some that are much
            smaller.
        </p>
        <h4>Trade Paperback</h4>
        <p>Paperback that has higher quality paper and materials, can be about the same size as a standard hardcover.
        </p>
        <h4>Mass Market Paperback</h4>
        <p>A book that is made to be mass produced in a short amount of time and are extremely portable, but due to the
            low
            quality of the pages and materials, they do not last as nearly as long.</p>
        <p>When I buy second hand, I tend to go for mass market because I do like ths smaller size and other than it
            being
            easy to carry around, they possibly can save a lot of space on my bookshelf and are cheap.</p>
        <p>I have found an article that goes into detail about the difference between trade paperback and mass market
            paperback if you are interested. <a
                href="https://kunzonpublishing.com/2017/07/mass-market-paperback-books-vs-trade-paperback-books-a-guide-for-self-publishers/">See
                here.</a></p>

        <h4>Extra</h4>
        <p>I don’t indulge in collecting the same books multiple times for different version and edition, I simply do
            not
            have space for the hobby. I do know releasing limited edition are to incite and have the same feeling as
            collecting something of value. And what other ways of releasing many versions with alternative looks and
            additional content by jumping on the current hottest book trend on social media. I don’t keep up with the
            trend
            because I don’t go to the social media that often gets promoted there, but if I do feel curious about some
            of
            the popular books, I check if the library has the book. Checking the library for popular books helps get rid
            of
            any itch of making impulsive purchase because I do fear that if I hate the content of the book, then the
            book is
            a waste of space in my bookshelf. I do get those book urges to read them NOW when renting any books, popular
            or
            not.</p>
        <p>This does not fit but relates to physical books, there is this marketing that happened in recent years and
            affect
            anyone owning the older copies of the printed book, luckily the story content remains the same. Long story
            short
            a publishing company released a brand-new book from a popular book series as an exclusive edition, but the
            catch
            is that whichever store scheduled to be release have its own different version of bonus chapter that the
            other
            stores don’t have. This is collector hell and troublesome if you love the series but don’t have the expense
            to
            purchase all or rely on the library that likely won’t be ordered.</p>

        <h3 id="jumpA">Audiobooks</h3>
        <p>Audiobooks is a form of reading where the user listen to an audio format of the book, can be found through
            Libby/Overdrive with your library card or you can purchase through a subscription service. The most popular
            option for listening to audiobook is called Audible, owned by Amazon. Book content within the audiobook may
            have different version depending on the popularity called dramatized. These include sound effects, full
            voice actor cast, are made to be immersive than the standard audiobook spoken from one voice actor.
            Audiobook is an accessible format for people who has visual disability which is a neat inclusive way to
            reading. It also be used in other ways such as hands free for other tasks or for easy on the go option from
            your phone or car. </p>
        <h4>Extra</h4>
        <p>Some debate on if listening to an audiobook is considered a form of “reading”, it can be a little confusing
            since when you address that you “read” a book via listening from audiobook, you say I read this book rather
            than I listened to this book. </p>

        <h3 id="jumpD">Accessing Digital Books</h3>
        <p>You have many options to view digital books or E-Books, the most common form of reading E-Books is through
            your
            phone or through a E-Reader device, computer is fine. You can buy E-Books through Amazon which is the most
            accessible or through other services found on the internet. A low-cost alternative is renting from your
            library,
            it will allow you access to their digital database of leased E-Books. From what I know, the current app
            is called Libby which replaced the older Overdrive app, but Overdrive can still be accessed through your
            library
            Overdrive link. Libby does provide audiobooks so does Overdrive, renting from either is the same as renting
            physical books, but this time you are allowed to adjust the loan time.</p>
        <p>Amazon is the only company that provide ease of use when you use their services, having an Amazon account
            allows
            you to sync your digital books purchased or rented to your Kindle as long as it is connected to the
            internet.
        </p>
        <h4>Extra</h4>
        <p>There is a hot debate on when purchasing E-Books for the sole reason of owning the digital file, apparently
            you
            don’t because Amazon purchased the license to lease the digital books on the storefront. And obviously to
            use
            the digital content from them, you must use their services, and the digital contents are protected by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM </a>which
            is a type of copyright that protects the Intellectual Property. Not everyone like this because you simply
            cannot
            “own” a digital property that you spent money on. Another reason is due to corporation having the power to
            restrict you from having the digital content because you are on their turf, they are allowed to get rid of
            digital content they hosted out of anyone who has the lease without informing. The only way to get around
            this
            is to buy physical copies. </p>
        <p>Kindle is on a similar vein because the device is made for Amazon services and can only be used if there is
            an
            active Amazon account. There is no other way around it.</p>
        <h3 id="jumpER">E-Reader</h3>
        <p>This will mainly cover E-Reader devices, this section will just go over some alternative options of devices
            that
            are like Kindle. Keep in mind that most options listed are made to be distraction free as in it does not do
            too
            many things outside of the OS, just made for reading. I may in the future cover the ‘reading tablet’ within
            some
            brands, but I will mainly be talking about E-Readers that use E-Ink technology. Lastly, if you ever consider
            getting any of the E-Readers, research your needs.</p>
        <h4>Kindle</h4>
        <p>Produced and manufactured by Amazon LLC., is one of the most popular E-Reader in this market for its vast
            database, released since the late 2000’s.</p>
        <p>If you are not techie like me, the Kindle Basic is your best option if you don’t see yourself picking it up
            frequently and, on a budget, it does what you need in a typical E-Reader, reading your E-Book. Kindle
            Paperwhite
            have some quality-of-life upgrades such as warm light, faster processing, bigger screen, flush screen and
            wireless charging present in Signature Edition. </p>
        <p>While newer Kindle generation gets Usb-C, only in the 10th generation (2018) were stuck with micro usb port
            despite the universal use of Usb-C.</p>
        <p>Ever since the new Kindle refresh, you can manually update any older Kindle device to the current OS version
            that
            would match the fast speed present in the newest model.</p>
        <h4>Kobo</h4>
        <p>Has multiple variety of E-Reader devices and recently created a colored E-Ink device in their lineup, Kobo do
            have their own active E-Book store to purchase from with their device.</p>
        <h4>Nook</h4>
        <p>Barnes & Noble E-Reader, currently only have one E-Reader, both Glowlight 4 and Glowlight 4 Plus are
            available on
            their site. If you were tripping out and swore, they used to sell the Nook back in the day, you are right.
            Nook
            discontinued their E-Book and digital service on their Bookstore of this year, unfortunate.</p>
        <h4>LCD/OLED Tablet</h4>
        <p>Basically, I’ve seen people use their iPad to “convert” it into an E-Reader by using the Kindle App. It is
            doable
            to do, but if bright colorful screen hurts your eye that’s where E-Ink comes in. And if having an option to
            switch app distracts you from reading, that’s where a dedicated E-Reader comes in.</p>
        <p>There is Reading Tablets that functions like a standard tablet but has the company E-Book store attached, but
            they will be written up soon.</p>
        <h4>Extra</h4>
        <p>Companies in this market are now capitalizing on the color E-Ink, I personally prefer the standard black and
            white. I can only see a use in color if you want colored highlights or see colored graphic novels and maybe
            magazines. Other than that, don’t expect the colors to be very vibrant like an OLED screen *cough* ipad
            *cough*,
            they are in their infancy stage. Overall E-Reader is a cool product for a niche hobby especially the
            E-Ink technology it is fitting. </p>
        <h3 id="jumpR">Resource</h3>
        <p>I’ve been talking a lot on public library because I do use their services, but there is one reason why you
            should
            be using it more often. Before, you will get penalize for not returning books on time, but ever since the
            pandemic, they made changes to the return policy. Now they got rid of the late return fee, you don't need to
            worry about a looming deadline. You can read more <a
                href="https://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/borrower-services#loans">here.</a> I had returned books past the 3
            weeks window, instead it will auto renew the due date. But obviously don’t try
            to keep it, I don’t know when it is considered too long to borrow.</p>
        <p>There are many things you can do in public library; they offer many services you can try to take advantage
            of.
            <a href="https://www.lapl.org/">LAPL website</a>. I always head over to My Library Account, this will allow
            me
            to rent books within
            their catalogs,
            after finding what I want I set it to deliver to my library to pick up.
        </p>
