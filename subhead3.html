    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>Before you get started on your reading journey, it is important to know where to start picking up books based on their genres. Here are several genres that should help narrow down your interest, some books contain multiple genres (ie. romance & fantasy) they will be placed in both genres.</p>

    <p>Accessing Physical Books</p>
    <p>You can access any physical books in local retailers or in dedicated book stores and thriftstores. Another method is loaning from your public library, if you do, check if your library do carry for pick-up. If your library do not carry the book but other branches of library do, it will be transported to your selected public library to be picked up from there. After that there is a loan period, before the pandemic library books used to come with a late fee for not returning on time, now they waived the late fees and auto renew past due date for free. Public library now implemented unlimited free return of the books since it was found that with no late fee for loaned books, there was a high increase in book returns.</p>
